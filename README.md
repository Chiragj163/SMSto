# SMSto
Developed an Android application enabling offline image transmission via SMS for remote areas with no internet connectivity. Designed and implemented a pipeline (JPEG compression, Base64 encoding, GZIP) to encode 200x200 images into 4â€“33 SMS segments, achieving 98% encoding and 92% decoding success rates across 100 agricultural and medical images. Optimized image quality (PSNR ~27.38 dB, SSIM = 0.85) and resolved challenges like "Bad Base-64" errors (6% failure rate) and dimension mismatches by integrating resizing and error checks. Contributed to UI development, testing, and documentation, enhancing communication for farmers and doctors. Proposed future enhancements, including AI-based super-resolution and multi-media support (audio, text). Demonstrated skills in Android development, image processing, and problem-solving, delivering a scalable solution for rural connectivity.
